# Landing Page — Mabini

This project is a simple landing page website designed to showcase tourists spots in Mabini. It’s intended to give visitors a clear, attractive first impression


##  What It Does

* Presents a **hero / introduction section** to communicate the core value or message of your service.
* Highlights main **features / benefits / selling points** of the service or product.
* Provides **clear call-to-action (CTA)** buttons to direct visitors — such as “Get Started”, “Learn More”, or “Contact Us”.
* Offers a clean, **responsive design** that looks good on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* Uses consistent layout and styling to provide a professional and trustworthy appearance.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Deployment

* Built with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.
* Static site that can be easily hosted anywhere — currently deployed on **Vercel**. ([Starter HTML][1])
* If you want to host locally or for development: clone the repo and open `index.html` (or use a local server).

## 🚀 How to Use / Deploy Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd landing-page-project

# (Optional) If using any build tools — install dependencies
npm install  # only if dependencies exist

# Open the site
open index.html  # or start a local server and visit http://localhost:<port>
```

Since it's a static site, there's no backend — you just need a web server or static hosting (like Vercel, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.) to serve the files.
